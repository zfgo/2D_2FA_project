\section{Introduction}

TODO: need to go through and reword/edit this section

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is the contemporary approach to
authorizing a user. The first authentication factor is the user's
password, with the second factor being an additional piece of
information that only the user could know, often a PIN or a push
notification sent to the user over a secure channel to a trusted device.
However, both PIN-2FA and push-based 2FA have some issues, which are
addressed in the paper ``2D-2FA: A New Dimension In Two-Factor
Authentication'' by Maliheh Shirvanian and Shashank Agrawal
\cite{shirvanian2d2fa}.

Some attacks to these two common 2FA methods include shoulder surfing,
short PINs, and neglectful user approvals. The authors present a new
approach to 2FA, which they have coined ``2D-2FA.'' In this new
approach, when a user logs in with their username and password, a
unique identifier is displayed to them. The user then inputs
this same identifier on their device. A one-time PIN is generated on the
device, and transferred automatically to the server, along with the
identifier. The identifier is used in the PIN's computation, so that the
PIN is bound to a specific session. 

The user's device and the server agree on a secret key during a one-time
registration process, which is also used in the PIN computation. Once
the PIN is transferred to the server, the server authenticates the
session associated with the identifier by verifying the PIN, thereby
taking two dimensions into account (the PIN and the identifier).

\subsection{Keywords}

To avoid further confusion, we will address several important keywords
that are important to the design and implementation of the 2D-2FA
system. 

\paragraph{2D-2FA} This is the name of the system that is outlined in
\cite{shirvanian2d2fa}. It uses no third party software, and relies only
on standardized encryption and hashing algorithms, as well as
standardized network protocols. The two dimensions that this system uses
to authenticate the user is the identifier and the PIN.

\paragraph{Identifier} This is a random value that is generated by the
server and presented to the user via the client interface. The user
needs to enter the identifier onto their device, where it is used during
the PIN generation. The server then uses the identifier that it
originally generated to verify the PIN. In \cite{shirvanian2d2fa}, they
recommend using a pattern or a QR code as the identifier for ease of
use. In our implementation, we used a 6-digit number as the identifier
to increase the ease of implementation. 

\paragraph{PIN} The PIN is generated using the time slice and the
identifier. It is sent to 
\paragraph{User} words words words
\paragraph{Client} words words words
\paragraph{Server} words words words
\paragraph{Device} words words words

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Motivations}

We are motivated to work on this project for several key reasons.
Firstly, the subject of this project has real-world relevance. 2FA is
becoming increasingly more common to authenticate users, and as it
becomes more prevalent, attackers will focus more of their efforts on
finding ways to break through its layers of security. Our project will
help us learn about ways to further increase the security of 2FA by
using additional information along with the user's credentials and the
server-provided ``identifier.''

This is also a learning opportunity for us. Neither of us are very
familiar with security, and it is something that we are very interested
in learning about. By completing this project, we will develop valuable
technical skills and increase our knowledge base, as well as preparing
us for future projects and industry roles.

Lastly, this project could have a real impact on end-users. 2FA enhances
users' trust and confidence in online systems by making their personal
information and online interactions more secure. This project has the
potential to contribute to a larger goal of make a more secure digital
environment. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Objectives}

Our objectives for this project are to create a working implementation
of the 2D-2FA system in software, focusing mainly on the authentication
phase, as described in section 3.2 of \cite{shirvanian2d2fa}. As
previously mentioned in our progress report, we have written software to
implement the functionality of the server and the device in this
authentication scheme. We also added a simple web interface for the
client and the device, so that the user can use their browser to use our
implementation. 

In terms of specific deliverables, these were outlined in our midterm
report, but are repeated here for posterity.

\section{Related Work}

In this section, we will look at some traditional 2FA implementations,
chiefly hardware token-based authentication and single sign-on software
token-based authentication.

\subsection{Design}

The 2D-2FA system consists of two phases, the registration phase and the
authentication phase. In our project, we assumed that the registration
phase had already been completed between the involved parties, but we
will go over that phase here because it would be required for the
implementation of a full 2D-2FA system, rather than a toy example or
proof of concept implementation.

\paragraph{Registraion Phase}
During the registration phase, the parties involved in the 2D-2FA
protocol need to establish communication channels between them, and
share secret keys between the server and the device. 

First, a user would register their username and password with the
server. The server would pick a secret key for that user (generating it
from their password using HMAC). The secret then needs to be transferred
to the user's device (e.g., cell phone), which is typically done by
manually entering it into the device, or by scanning a QR code generated
by the server. This is so that the device will be able to generate PINs
later on in the 2D-2FA process. 

The server stores a hash of the user's password and secret key, and the
device stores only the secret key related to the user's account stored
on the server. The client (e.g., a web browser on a laptop that the user
uses to log in to the server) does not store any information during the
registration phase. 

\paragraph{Authentication Phase}
The authentication phase involves the interaction of the parties to
authenticate the user to the server in a secure fashion. 

First, the user attempts to log in to the server from the client. The
user's login information (username and password) are used as the first
authentication factor. Next, the server displays a unique identifier to
the user through the client (the identifier can be implemented in a
variety of ways, either via QR code, a fourgram pattern as described in
section 6.1 of \cite{shirvanian2d2fa}, and so on). 

On the user's device, the user selects the server that they are logging
in to, and enters the identifier that was displayed to them on the
client. The device generates a PIN using the identifier, the current
time, and the user's secret key. The PIN and the identifier are sent to
the server.

When the server receives the PIN and the identifier, it authenticates
the user's session associated with the identifier, generating several
PINs to find one that matches with the time the PIN was generated on the
user's device. During this phase, the server keeps a temporary record of
all active sessions and identifiers.

\subsection{Security}

TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO

There are several possible avenues of attack to the 2D-2FA system that
are proposed in \cite{shirvanian2d2fa}. In this section, we will go over
each attack vector and analyze how the system protects against these
attacks. 

\paragraph{Client Compromise}
An attacker would need to compromise the client that the user uses to
log into the server, and thus would learn the user's password. Even with
the user's password, 

If the attacker knows the user's password, they can get an identifier
from the server. However, without the user's device, they don't have
their secret key for the PIN computation.

\paragraph{Device Compromise}
The attacker can access the user's secret key, but they have no
information about the user's password, and thus can not log in to get an
identifier from the server.

\paragraph{Channel Compromise}
There are three channels, each connecting the client (C), the server
(S), and the device (D), as seen in the image below. Similar to the
device compromise, the attacker can not get the user's secret key. While
the channel from the device to the server is a regular channel that the
attacker can get the identifier and the PIN from, they can not use these
to authenticate themselves. 

\paragraph{User Negligence}
This occurs when a user accidentally approves an attacker's session.
This only happens if a user enters an identifier that doesn't match the
one displayed to them, and does match the identifier given to the
attacker. In our implementation, the chances of this occurring is 1 in a
million (0.0001\%).

\paragraph{Attacks on Third Parties}
2D-2FA does not use any 3rd parties or introduce any additional
authentication infrastructure into its system beyond those that are
already well established (HMAC, SSL/TLS, random number generation,
etc.), and thus we do not need to rely on any 3rd parties, eliminating
this risk.

\subsection{Lessons}

The important lessons that we have learned include project planning,
collaboration skills, and iterative development. While we had prior
experience in all of these areas from previous projects, this project
helped ingrain these principles into how we worked, altogether adding to
a better workflow and increased productivity. 

For the project planning, we had thoroughly read through the
implementation section in \cite{shirvanian2d2fa}. From this, we 
broke down each element of the implementation into smaller chunks that
were easier to tackle and implement. This allowed us to develop one
module at a time, and ensure that module was functioning in the desired
way before continuing to the next module. 

In terms of collaboration, we have weekly meetings where we discuss what
we have accomplished in the past week, and what we plan on completing
for the next week. During the week, we update each other with our
progress, as well as asking questions or seeing if we have suggestions
for each other. 

With regard to iterative development, this goes hand in hand with our
project planning. Because we have broken down the problem into
bite-sized chunks, we can iteratively implement these small portions,
easily adding features and functionality to them as we progress, and
iteratively changing them or modifying them when we encounter the need
to do so.
